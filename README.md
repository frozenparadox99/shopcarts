## Overview

The `/service` folder contains `models.py` file for the model and a `routes.py` file for the service. The `/tests` folder has test cases for testing the model and the service separately. You can use the [lab-flask-tdd](https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-tdd) for code examples to copy from.

## Automatic Setup

The best way to use this repo is to start your own repo using it as a git template. To do this just press the green **Use this template** button in GitHub and this will become the source for your repository.

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```

## Contents

The project contains the following:

```text
.gitignore          - this will ignore vagrant and other metadata files
.flaskenv           - Environment variables to configure Flask
.gitattributes      - File to gix Windows CRLF issues
.devcontainers/     - Folder with support for VSCode Remote Containers
dot-env-example     - copy to .env to use environment variables

## Shopcart Model Overview

This service provides an API for managing shopping carts. Developers can easily set up and run the project using **DevContainer** in **VS Code** with Docker.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install **Docker**
- Install **VS Code** with the **DevContainers extension**

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. When prompted, reopen in a DevContainer.
4. Once the container starts, the service will be ready to use.

## API Documentation

### Routes

#### Shopcarts
- `GET /shopcarts` - Lists all shopcarts grouped by user.

#### Shopcart operations

- `POST /shopcarts/{user_id}` - Adds an item to a user's shopcart or updates quantity if it already exists.
- `GET /shopcarts/{user_id}` - Retrieves the shopcart with metadata.
- `PUT /shopcarts/{user_id}` - Updates the entire shopcart.
- `DELETE /shopcarts/{user_id}` - Deletes the entire shopcart (all items).

#### ShopCart Items

- `POST /shopcarts/{user_id}/items` - Adds a product to a user's shopcart or updates quantity.
- `GET /shopcarts/{user_id}/items` - Lists all items in the user's shopcart (without metadata).

#### Specific Shopcart Item

- `GET /shopcarts/{user_id}/items/{item_id}` - Retrieves a specific item from the user's shopcart.
- `PUT /shopcarts/{user_id}/items/{item_id}` - Updates a specific item in the shopcart.
- `DELETE /shopcarts/{user_id}/items/{item_id}` - Removes an item from the shopcart.

#### Usage Examples

You can interact with the API using Postman, curl, or any similar tool.

- To **retrieve** a shopcart for a user with `user_id = 5` (with metadata):

```GET http://localhost:8080/shopcarts/5```

- To **list** all items in a user's shopcart:

```GET http://localhost:8080/shopcarts/5/items```

- To **add an item** to a user's shopcart, send a `POST` request with `JSON` data:
 
```POST http://localhost:8080/shopcarts/5```

```
json={
  "item_id": "123",
  "quantity": 2,
  "price": 9.99
}
```

- To **update** a specific item in the shopcart:

```PUT http://localhost:8080/shopcarts/5/items/123```

- To **delete** an item from the shopcart:

```DELETE http://localhost:8080/shopcarts/5/items/123```
